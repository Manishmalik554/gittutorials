# ðŸŽµ Music Sales Analysis - SQL Project
## Project Overview- 
This project involves an in-depth analysis of music sales data using SQL. The aim was to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, such as identifying top-performing customers, revenue-driving cities, and countries with the highest invoice counts. In this analysis, various SQL techniques were applied, including Joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Recursive Queries.

### Key Features
**Joins:** Merged multiple tables to get insights such as customer spending and employee details.
**CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Simplified complex queries for easier understanding and reusability.
**Recursive Queries:** Analyzed hierarchical data, such as employee management structures.
**Aggregate Functions:** Calculated total sales, invoice counts, and customer spending.
**Grouping & Ordering:** Ranked cities, countries, and customers based on various metrics.

### Insights Breakdown
**Identify the Senior-most Employee**
Query that returns the employee with the highest position based on their job title.

**Top Countries by Invoice Count**
Grouped and ordered countries by the number of invoices generated.

**Top 3 Highest Invoice Values**
Queried the top 3 invoices with the highest total value.

**Best City for a Music Festival**
Calculated which city has the highest total sales for planning a potential promotional event.

**Best Customer by Total Spend**
Found the customer who has spent the most money on music purchases.

### Technologies Used
SQL: Core language used for querying and data manipulation.
DBMS: Any SQL-compatible database can be used to run these queries (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

### Project Highlights
Demonstrates advanced SQL skills, including the use of Joins, CTEs, and Recursive Queries.
Provides insights that can be useful for business decision-making, such as planning promotions or identifying key customers.
Helps in mastering data manipulation, query optimization, and data aggregation.
